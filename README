INTRODUCTION
------------
Paragraph Adjuster with Hyphenation (PAwH) is a small Perl script that
reformats  lines of ASCII text so that the resulting lines are  justi-
fied  in  any  of  the following  formats:  left-justified  (default),
right-justified, centered, or both left- and right-justified. PAwH has
various  switches, most are optional, to control its output. The  only
mandatory switch is the line width (--width). For PAwH to work proper-
ly, input paragraphs must be separated by blank lines.


USAGE
-----
You can use PAwH in any of two ways:

./paradj.pl --width=n [options] file1 [file2 file3 ...]

or

cat file1 [file2 file3 ...] | ./paradj.pl --width=n [options]

where file1, file2, file3, and so on, are the files to be reformatted.
There's only one output, though.


SWITCHES
--------
The available switches are:

--width=n (or -w=n or -w n)
    Line width is n chars long

--left (or -l)
    Output is left-justified (default)

--right (or -r)
    Output is right-justified

--centered (or -c)
    Output is centered

--both (or -b)
    Output is both left- and right-justified

--indent=n (or -i=n or -i n)
    Leave n spaces for initial indention (defaults to 0)

--newline (or -n)
    Insert blank lines between paragraphs

--hyphenate (or -h)
    Hyphenate word that doesn't fit on a line


EXAMPLES
--------
The  following command reformats the file, LICENSE (it comes with this
distribution),  so that the line width is at most 70 characters,  both
left-  and right-justified, with blank lines inserted between consecu-
tive  paragraphs,  and words are hyphenated when they can't fit  on  a
line.

paradj.pl --width=70 --both --newline --hyphenate LICENSE

You can also use the shortened version:

paradj.pl -w=70 -b -n -h LICENSE

If  you  want to indent each paragraph, just use the --indent  switch.
Say, you want to indent the LICENSE file with 4 leading spaces, type:

paradj.pl --width=70 --both --newline --hyphenate --indent=4 LICENSE

or

paradj.pl -w=70 -b -n -h -i=4 LICENSE


GUI VERSION
-----------
There  is  also  a Perl/Tk version of  paradj.pl,  paradj-tk.pl.  This
Perl/Tk  version  is  less  flexible than  the  command-line  version,
though, because it can only read one file at a time.


REQUIREMENT
-----------
You  need Jan Pazdziora's Perl module, TeX::Hyphen, available from the
Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN), to use the hyphenation fea-
ture. I have included TeX::Hyphen with this distribution for your con-
venience only; you are encouraged to check out the latest version from
CPAN.

For  Windows  users,  you can install TeX::Hyphen by  following  these
steps:

1. Uncompress the TeX::Hyphen module, TeX-Hyphen-0.140.tar.gz.

2.  Descend (cd) into the TeX-Hyphen-0.140/lib and copy the TeX direc-
tory into <Perl directory>\lib. For example, if your Perl binaries are
installed on E:\Perl, copy the TeX directory into E:\Perl\lib.
